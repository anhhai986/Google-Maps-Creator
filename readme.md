## System requirements

Make sure your server meets the requirements below. Most of the PHP libraries are installed by default.

   - MCrypt PHP Extension
   - PHP SQLite3 PDO
 - Apache mod_rewrite
 - MySQL (optional)

## Installation

### Upload files

Upload all files to the webroot of your hosting account.

### Directory permissions

The `/app/storage/` directory and all underlying files and directories need write permissions.

 - /app/storage/cache/
 - /app/storage/logs/
 - /app/storage/meta/
 - /app/storage/meta/services.json
 - /app/storage/sessions/
 - /app/storage/uploads/
 - /app/storage/views/
 - /app/database/
 - /app/database/production.sqlite

### Encryption key
In order to improve security, open `/app/config/app.php`, look for the `key` setting and change the random string. Make sure you only use letters (uppercase or lowercase) and numbers.

```php
/*
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Encryption Key
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 | This key is used by the Illuminate encrypter service and should be set
 | to a random, 32 character string, otherwise these encrypted strings
 | will not be safe. Please do this before deploying an application!
 |
 */

'key' => 'mcMTR7QLdDycOEmf2JAtyqy942cbhIqO',
```

### Google Maps API key

Get your Google Maps API key here and enter it in `/app/config/production/google.php`.

### Database

Google Maps Creator works out of the box with an SQLite database. However, if you want to use a MySQL database this is possible, too.
If you want to use a MySQL database, create one on your server. Open the file `/app/config/production/database.php` and change `'default' => 'sqlite'` to `'default' => 'mysql'`. Enter the database name, username and password at the lines below.

You can leave the SQLite reference intact, only change the default driver. Now `/app/config/production/database.php` looks something like:

```php
return array(

	'default' => 'mysql',
	'connections' => array(

		'mysql' => array(
			'driver'    => 'mysql',
			'host'      => 'localhost',
			'database'  => 'database_name',
			'username'  => 'user',
			'password'  => 'pass',
		),

		'sqlite' => array(
			'database' => app_path() .'/database/production.sqlite',
		),
	),

);
```

When you open the url where Google Maps Creator is installed for the first time, the database content will be generated.

### Email configuration

For the configuration on how automated mails like registration and lost password are sent, open `/app/config/production/mail.php`. The file should be self-explanatory:

### First login

After you've installed Google Maps Creator, visit the URL where you've installed it (e.g. http://website.com/login) and login with the following credentials:

E-mail: info@example.com
Password: welcome
